/*
 * Creates all the demo application tasks, then starts the scheduler.  The WEB
 * documentation provides more details of the standard demo application tasks
 * (which just exist to test the kernel port and provide an example of how to use
 * each FreeRTOS API function).
 *
 * In addition to the standard demo tasks, the following tasks and tests are
 * defined and/or created within this file:
 *
 * "LCD" task - the LCD task is a 'gatekeeper' task.  It is the only task that
 * is permitted to access the display directly.  Other tasks wishing to write a
 * message to the LCD send the message on a queue to the LCD task instead of
 * accessing the LCD themselves.  The LCD task just blocks on the queue waiting
 * for messages - waking and displaying the messages as they arrive.  The use
 * of a gatekeeper in this manner permits both tasks and interrupts to write to
 * the LCD without worrying about mutual exclusion.  This is demonstrated by the
 * check hook (see below) which sends messages to the display even though it
 * executes from an interrupt context.
 *
 * "Check" hook -  This only executes fully every five seconds from the tick
 * hook.  Its main function is to check that all the standard demo tasks are
 * still operational.  Should any unexpected behaviour be discovered within a
 * demo task then the tick hook will write an error to the LCD (via the LCD task).
 * If all the demo tasks are executing with their expected behaviour then the
 * check task writes PASS to the LCD (again via the LCD task), as described above.
 *
 * LED tasks - These just demonstrate how multiple instances of a single task
 * definition can be created.  Each LED task simply toggles an LED.  The task
 * parameter is used to pass the number of the LED to be toggled into the task.
 *
 * "uIP" task -  This is the task that handles the uIP stack.  All TCP/IP
 * processing is performed in this task.
 *
 * "Fast Interrupt Test" - A high frequency periodic interrupt is generated
 * using a free running timer to demonstrate the use of the
 * configKERNEL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY configuration constant.  The interrupt
 * service routine measures the number of processor clocks that occur between
 * each interrupt - and in so doing measures the jitter in the interrupt timing.
 * The maximum measured jitter time is latched in the ulMaxJitter variable, and
 * displayed on the OLED display by the 'OLED' task as described below.  The
 * fast interrupt is configured and handled in the timertest.c source file.
